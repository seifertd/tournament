I have moved the enumerations_mixin plugin to a 
new location at:

http://svn.protocool.com/public/plugins/enumerations_mixin/

So, if you're looking at this file from a web browser
and wondering why your svn:externals suddenly stopped working,
that's why.  

While you're updating your svn:externals you might want
to take a look at Piston - it's a much better way to 
manage your plugins and externals:
