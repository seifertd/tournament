== DESCRIPTION:

Small library, command line program and Rails web GUI for managing a NCAA
basketball tournament pool.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Fully functional, self-service web GUI for collecting entries and
  generating reports
* Or use command line to add NCAA tournament pool entries and save them as YAML
* Run a possibilities report for determining who is likely to win
* Run other reports such as a leader board and entry report
* [DEPRECATED] Buggy, but functional, Shoes GUI included for creating
  the entries and updating the tournament results bracket.  Useful as an
  adjunct to the command line script.
* FIXME: Complete the test suite for the library and command line tool

== COMMAND LINE SYNOPSIS:

The tournament command line program is installed as 'pool'.  The library
has the 2009 NCAA tournament pre-configured.  If you were to use
this library for the 2010 NCAA tournament, code changes would be
necessary. FIXME: (add ability to read teams from a simple configuration
file).  For usage, just execute

   pool --help

For command specific usage, execute

   pool <command> --help

where <command> is one of the available commands described below. The
pool command saves state in a file called pool.yml by default.  This
can be overridden in all cases by using the --save-file option.

The pool manager would use this program as follows:

1. Choose a scoring strategy.  There are various scoring strategies
   that could be used.  The library comes pre-configured with 
   three scoring strategies:
   1. Basic scoring strategy: each correct pick is worth 2 X the round.
   2. Upset favoring strategy: each correct pick is worth a
      base amount per round plus the seed number of the winner.  As
      pre-configured, the base amounts per round are 3, 5, 11, 19, 30
      and 40 points.
   3. The Josh Patashnik stratgy: each correct pick is worth the
      winner's seed number X a round multiplier.  The multipliers
      are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 points.
   If your scoring strategy is not one of the above, you will have to
   add a class to the ScoringStrategy module, in file
   lib/tournament/scoring_strategy.rb.

2. Create a directory to hold the pool data and change to it

3. Initialize the pool

       pool setup [--scoring=upset_scoring_strategy]

   Use the --scoring argument to change to the upset favoring 
   strategy.  If the basic strategy is ok, the --scoring argument is
   not required.

   As mentioned above, unless overridden by using the --save-file
   option, the pool will save itself to the file 'pool.yml'

4. Set the entry fee and payout amounts
   
       pool fee 10
       pool payout 1 80
       pool payout 2 20
       pool payout last 10 -C

   The above commands say that each entry fee is 10 units (this is all
   for fun, not profit, right?) and that the 1st place finisher would
   receive 80% of the total payout, the 2nd place finisher would 
   receive 20% of the total payout and the last place finisher would
   receive 10 units back (would get her entry fee back).  No error
   checking is done with this.  FIXME: Add error checking.

5. Export a tournament entry YAML file

       pool dump

   This will save the tournament entry file as tournament.yml unless
   the --entry option is used to override it.

6. Create entries.  You can use the included buggy GUI (see below),
   or edit YAML files by hand.

7. Import the entry YAML files into the pool

       pool entry --add=path/to/entry.yml

8. As games progress, update the tournament.yml file, again using the GUI or
   editing the YAML file by hand.  Then update the pool with the new
   pool YAML file

       pool update

9. Run reports
  
       pool report [final_four|entry|region|leader|score]

   The final four report can only be run once the final four teams have
   been determined.

10. After about 22 teams are left, run a possibility report.  This report will
    run through all the remaining ways the tournament can come out and
    calculate the chance to win for each player.  The chance to win
    is defined as the percentage of possibilities that lead to that player
    coming out on top in the pool.  With more than about 22 teams left
    (YMMV), this report could take months to run. FIXME (Investigate
    possibly using EC2 or something to spread the load around, or 
    otherwise optimize the possibility checking algorithm)

== WEB GUI:

A Rails web application is available if you don't want to use the
command line to manage your pool.

=== INSTALLING THE WEB GUI:

The web application can be installed by running the pool command
as follows

   pool install_webgui --web-dir=/path/to/directory [options]

The above command will copy the Rails app to the specified directory.

There are several options you can provide in addition to --web-dir
to control how the application is installed:

 * Human readable site name.  This appears as the <title> tag content
   of pages in the site and is also used in the subject line of any
   emails sent by the site (as during user registration).

   --site-name="Site Name"  (Default: 'Tournament')

 * Relative url root.  If you will be installing the pool site as
   a relative url on another virtual host, use this switch.  You
   will have to configure you virtual host to route requests to this
   path to Rails.  This is ridiculously easy if you are using
   modrails and Apache.  Example:

   --relative-root=/my_pool  (Default: empty, no root is set)
 
 * Administrator email address.  The web GUI will send emails
   when users register for creating entries in a pool. The following
   sets the from email address on the emails that are sent.

   --admin-email=admin

 * Email server information.  Either edit the config/initializers/pool.rb
   file after installation, or provide the following options to configure
   a SMTP server available on your domain.

   --email-server=smtp.myisp.com
   --email-port=25
   --email-domain=mydomain.com
   --email-user=myuser
   --email-password=mypass
   --email-auth=login|plain|cram_md5

   See http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#_action_mailer_configuration
   for more info on how to configure a Rails app for sending email.

 * The web GUI has the ability to print bracket entries by generating
   a pdf styled using the web site's bracket stylesheet.  It uses a third
   party tool called Prince XML to do this.  You are not allowed to
   use this on a server without paying a license fee, although you
   can download a trial version for personal use.  It's your call
   whether or not you want to use this.  Please see http://www.princexml.com/
   for more details.
 
   --use-princexml=/full/path/to/prince

   If prince is not available on the path you specify, the princexml
   distribution will be downloaded and installed using the distribution's
   install.sh script.  In order to do this, the tar program must be
   available on your installation system.

 * If you use the --use-princexml option, the install script needs to write
   files to a temp directory, /tmp by default. Use the --tmp-dir option to
   change this default.  If the specified temp dir does not exist, it will
   be created.

   --tmp-dir=/path/to/tmp/dir

=== POST-INSTALLATION:

Before being able to run the web gui for the first time, you have to
prepare the sqlite database and create an admin account.  To do this,
change to the installation directory and run the following command:

   RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate

To create the admin account, change to the web gui installation directory
and run the following command:

   RAILS_ENV=production rake "admin:create[login,email,name,password]"

In the above command, substitute "login" for the desired admin user's login
name, "email" for the administrators email address, "name" for the 
admin user's name (eg, "Joe Admin"), and "password" for the desired
admin account password

=== USING THE WEB GUI:

Load the entry page in your brower.  Log in as the admin user you 
configured during installation.  Click on on the 'All Pools' link on
the right sidebar.  Create a new pool and fill in the information.
Each time you save this form, a new blank payouts line will be added
so that you can configure as many payouts as you desire.

After the basic pool configuration is set up, click on the 'Teams'
link in the right sidebar.  You are presented with four region
brackets to fill in.  Keep in mind that the pink region champs will
play each other in the final four and the light blue region champs
will play each other in the final four so you can get the bracket 
right.  The web application is preconfigured with over 300 NCAA
schools.  The team name fields are auto-complete fields -- type in
a few letters and pause and you will be presented with a list of
matching teams.  The Short Name field should be a three letter
abbreviation for the team.  The abbreviations have to be unique
across the entire tournament field.

Once the teams are configured, go back to the pool basic information
form, click the Active check box and save the form.  The pool is now
ready for entries to be added to it.  Invite your friends to join the pool
by giving them the url for the entry page.  They will be asked to
register.  After registering and logging in, they will be able to
submit entries to your pool.

As the tournament progresses, use the 'Tournament Bracket' link
on the right sidebar to record the winning teams.  

Use the report links to run reports, etc.

== SHOES GUI:

A GUI for filling out tournment bracket entries is included and is run
by executing the program "picker".  If no argument is included, a blank
entry is started.  It can be filled in and saved using one of the buttons
at the top of the screen.  The entry is saved as a YAML file for a
Tournament::Entry object.   The picker program optionally takes one
argument, the path to a Tournament::Entry YAML file.  It will open
with the provided entry's picks pre filled in.

The GUI also may be used for keeping the NCAA tournament entry YAML file
up to date:

   picker tournament.yml

The GUI works as long as you don't try to go back and change games
from played to unknown outcome.
